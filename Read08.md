# Evaluating conditions and conditional statements
    - There are two different components 
        1. An expression which is evaluated which then returns a value.
        2. A conditional state that says what to do in a certain situation.

    - Evaluation of a condition, the code checks the current script which is done by comparing two vaules and the result of it would be true or false.
    - Conditional statements is based on a concpet of if/then/else; if the condition is met then your code does one or more states or does somthing different. 

# Comparison operators evaluating conditions
    - You can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what you think it could be. The result is a boolean which is true or false. Examples of booleans are 
        1. == this is equal, meaning it compares two values to see if they are the same. 
        2. != is not equal to, meaning it compares two values to see if they are not the same. 
        3. ==== this is strict equal to, meaning it compares two values to check that both the data type and value are the same. 
        4. !== strict not equal to. meaning it compares two values to check that both the data type and value are not the same. 

# Structuring comparison operators
    - In every condition there is usually one operator and two operands. The operands are placesd on each side of the operator. They can be either values or varibles. Example (score >=pass)

# Loops
    - Loops check a condition, if it returns true a code block will run, which will run again and if its still true the code will run again. It keeps repeating until the condition returns false. There are three common types of looops
        1. For loop, if you know how many times your code will run this is a for loop.
        2. While loop, if you dont know how many times you code will run.
        3. Do while loop, which is very similiar to the while loom but the difference is that it will always run the statements inside the curly barces at least once even if the condition is false. 

# Loop counters 
    - A for loop uses a counter as a condition. This tell the code to run a specified number of times. Here are the condition statements,  
        1. Initialization var 1 = 0; the variable is only created the first time the loop is run.
        2. Condition i<10;  the value of i was initially set to 0, so in this case the loop will run 10 times before stopping.
        3. Update i++ One is added to the counter using the increment (++).
