# Introducing CSS Chapter 10 
 
    - What is CSS (cascading style sheet), it allows you to create rules that specify how the content of a page should look like. Examples of css it allows you to specify the background of the page, how paragraphs should appear, what font to use, and what colors you want

Selectors indicate which element the rule applies to. The same rule can apply to more than one element if you separate the element names with commas.

Declarations indicate how
the elements referred to in the selector should be styled. Declarations are split into two parts (a property and a value), and are separated by a colon.

CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.
