## Welcome to Reading Notes

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/hasankhalifeh/readingnotes/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown.
Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.
1. You can read more about Markdown using this following link [google](https://google.com)
2. If you want to master markdown you can use the follow link [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

## Examples for Markdown
1. If you want to change the style of the word you can use ** in front and at the end. Another type is using * at the front and * at the end to make it *italic* 
2. You can also input pictures into markdown using the following code ![Image of Ferrari](https://thenewswheel.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/2015-Ferrari-California.jpg)
3. Markdown has many more options that you can explore using the Master Markdown website that I have linked above.

## Syntax Guide
- There are headers which can be used with #
- Emphasis depending on the * one or two to change the style.
- Listing Items on Markdown 
- Inserting images like shown above
- Link urls and other websites. 
- Using Blockquotes with > 
- Using and Inline code with '<>'

## Syntax Highlights
```JavaScript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
``` 
### There is an easier way by indent 4 spaces which will make it look like the following 
    function fancyAlert(arg) {
      if(arg) {
        $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
      }
    }
  
## Task Lists
- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item

## Tables
To create a table, you must assemble a group of words and separate with - and |:
The following is an example of how it should look like

First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column

## SHA References 
Any reference to a commit SHA-1 hash the outcome will be converted into a GitHub

# Growth Mindset
- What is growth mindset, it is the growth and perseverance of one’s knowledge and effort to become good at what he wants to do. It is a tool that is used for one to grow into something he wanted to become such as becoming a **great coder**.

### Here is a table that describes growth mindset
Fixed | Growth
------------ | -------------
Avoids | Embraces
Loses Focus | Persist
Views as fruitless | No pain no gain
Ignores | Learns from
Views as threats | Is inspired of 

- Always have a positive mindset towards new things as it helps us win in every scene, due to not having a fixed solution for everything as everything needs change.

## Dedication 
- Starting a new program or work could be very challenging at first especially if you are in a new environment. Being in a new environment can be very draining and tiring but without any of the following.
  1. Challenges
  When Faced with challenges we always try to overcome them and many times we fail before getting to the solution.
  2. Obstacles
  During work or school or even life we face many obstacles during our lifetime we fail many times but we always try to avoid failed but it is a key to success.
  3. Effort
  Without putting any effort during our worktime we will not succeed we will just stay in our place thinking we moved ahead.
  4. Criticism
  You always need criticism if it’s a business or a school or even a restaurant criticism is always the best way to gather positive and negative feedback about your work . 
  5. Success of Others 
  You always hear stories of people either around you or people you have heard of coming from a very bad spot to a better place. This gives us hope that everyone always has a chance to shine when the light seems hopeless.
