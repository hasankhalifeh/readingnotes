## Welcome to Reading Notes

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/hasankhalifeh/readingnotes/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown.
Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.
1. You can read more about Markdown using this following link [google](https://google.com)
2. If you want to master markdown you can use the follow link [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

## Examples for Markdown
1. If you want to change the style of the word you can use ** infront and at the end. Another type is using * at the front and * at the end to make it *italic* 
2. You can also input pictures into markdown using the following code ![Image of Ferrari](https://thenewswheel.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/2015-Ferrari-California.jpg)
3. Markdown has many more options that you can explore using the Master Markdown website that i have linked above.

## Syntax Guide
- There are headers which can be used with #
- Emphasis depending on the * one or two to change the style.
- Listing Items on Markdown 
- Inserting images like shown above
- Link urls and other websites. 
- Using Blockquotes wiht > 
- Using and Inline code with '<>'

## Syntax Highlights
```javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
``` 
### There is a easier way by indent 4 spaces which will make it look like the following 
    function fancyAlert(arg) {
      if(arg) {
        $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
      }
    }
  
## Task Lists
- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item

## Tables
To create a table you must assembile a group of words and sepreate with - and |:
The following is an example of how it should look like

First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column

## SHA References 
Any reference to a commit SHA-1 hash the outcome will be converted into a Github
